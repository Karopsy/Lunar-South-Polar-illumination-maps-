These codes have been created in order to compute solar illumination maps for a research project at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, TX. This work has implications for permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) scientific studies in the context of the upcoming Artemis III mission. 

A Python algorithm has been developed in order to automate the process of making the request, download and saving the illumination maps from the QuickMap software.
